# Metronome
Created by Blake Branvold and Varun Saini  
README.md written from Varun's perspective

There are tons of metronome apps out there, but very few use images and animations in conjunction with sound. For this app, Blake and I used Timer objects to schedule the playing of a sound and carefully lined up an animation with the sound. Although the app isn't perfect (because Timers don't have a separate thread to run on), it is a good proof of concept for our knowledge of Timers.
